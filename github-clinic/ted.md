# GitHub practice from the browser

Working on GitHub.com, we contribute changes through **commits**. You'll practice creating several commits by making small edits to a file, writing commit messages, and committing changes to see them posted nicely online to communicate our work. You'll practice with the file with your name on it; everyone has their own file to practice with. 

## Task 1: Commit an edit from the browser

Let's edit this file by clicking the pencil icon at the top-right of the file. 

Next, make an edit to the text in this file. One idea is to fix this typo. 

Here's my website: https://laderast.github.io

Finally, we will commit these edits to GitHub. To do this, press the green "Commit Changes..." button. Committing changes has two steps: write a human-readable Commit message, and press the green button to commit changes. 

Note: In the browser, GitHub will suggest "Update file.md" as the commit message. But you can be more descriptive - practice writing commit messages that help you remember detail about what you changed.

## Task 2: Practice Markdown 

Now let's practice Markdown and commit another edit to this file. 

This file is written in Markdown, which formats text on the web. To see the Markdown that results in the following formatting, click the pencil icon to edit, or click 'Raw' to inspect it. For example, with Markdown:

We can make words **bold** or *italic*.

### We can make headers.

We can make lists â€“ *note that lists need an empty line before list items!*

1. bananas
2. tamales
3. cakes

## Quote from Theodore Roosevelt

> It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcoming - Theodore Roosevelt
